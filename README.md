# MLTextParser

## A hello world NN framework
This project isn't meant to replace any existing NN frameworks. It's merely a training exercise to get my feet wet in unsupervised and supervised learning.

The final objective is to locate and parse text from images. I'll probably start using lasagne or some other framework after this... this is a lot of work :)
